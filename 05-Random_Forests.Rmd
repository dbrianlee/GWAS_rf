# Connecting the dots: Random Forests

* Start with an overview of what Random Forests can do for us in GWAS â€“ a very big picture explanation. 
* Explain the rationale for selecting a random subset of predictors at each split (random forests)
* Explain how the size of the random subset of predictors at each split relates to the bias-variance tradeoff
* Explain the rationale for and implement out-of-bag error estimation for both regression and classification
* Explain the rationale behind the random forest variable importance measure and why it is biased towards quantitative predictors
