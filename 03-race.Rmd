# The building blocks of Random Forests: Classification Decision Trees

- introduce decision trees: root node, decision nodes, leaf nodes
- pros (intuitive, easy to follow) & cons of decision trees (overfitting and greediness). 
- pruned vs unpruned trees, transition into greediness and the bias-variance tradeoff
- transition into next chapter -- What if we could use many of these weak predictive algorithms to create a more robust one?
