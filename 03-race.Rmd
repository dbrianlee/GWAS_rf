# Motivations

- Why should we care? Discussing ancestry as a confounding variable, cons of decision trees (overfitting and greediness). 
- Why did we choose to focus on random forests
- transition into next chapter -- What if we could use many of these weak predictive algorithms to create a more robust one?
